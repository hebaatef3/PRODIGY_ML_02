# Group customers of a retail store

***This repository contains implementation of K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history***

# Dataset
The model was built using dataset " Mall_Customers.csv" downloaded from Kaggle containing customer purchase history of a retail store

 # Getting Started 
 ### Prerequisites
 -   Python 3.x
 - Matplotlib:  `!pip install matplotlib`
 - seaborn:`!pip install seaborn`
-  NumPy:  `!pip install numpy`
- sklearn:  `!pip install sklearn`
-  pandas:  `!pip install pandas`

# Data Visualization
The shape of the data and its various distributions were presented with graphs
Also, compare the features described in the dataset with each other to increase the discovery of the data before building the model.

# K-Means Clustering
  
The model was built to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using K-Means algorithm 
To determine the number of clusters appropriate for building the model, this was done by drawing the elbow curve to illustrate the appropriate number of clusters for building the model.
